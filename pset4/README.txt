NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
I tested the code both on the Appliance and my Mac.
On my Mac, I would usually beat stdio 5-8 times and be ~1.3x faster
overall.
On the appliance, I would usually beat stdio 12-15 times and be
~1.45x faster.
It was particularly hard to reliably establish wether or not a
certain modification in my code caused an overall speed-up in my library
due to huge deltas in almost every test case on successive runs of
'make check'.

EXTRA CREDIT ATTEMPTED (if any):
